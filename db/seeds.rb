  "Experience micro-gravity living at its finest! This cozy escape pod is perfect for the solo traveler. Amenities include a zero-G hammock, a dehydrated food dispenser with a surprising variety of flavors, and porthole views that will make you feel like you're floating in a cosmic watercolor painting. Warning: May experience mild cabin fever after the third asteroid belt crossing.",
  "Buckle up for a wild ride! This converted cargo hauler is perfect for families (or groups of friends who never quite grew up). Features include a laser tag arena that doubles as the living room, a bouncy castle ball pit under the cockpit, and an escape pod playhouse for the little astronauts. Please note: We are not responsible for lost socks in the airlock.",
  "Looking for an out-of-this-world getaway for two? This luxurious shuttle comes with a private viewing deck perfect for stargazing, a gravity-defying hot tub, and a fully stocked bar that specializes in alien cocktails. The onboard AI butler can even serenade you with love songs from across the galaxy. Warning: May cause uncontrollable giggling fits due to champagne bubbles in zero-G.",
  "Get back to basics with this charmingly refurbished mining vessel.  Perfect for the adventurous spirit, this rugged spaceship comes equipped with a rock climbing wall on the exterior hull, a telescope for asteroid spotting, and a cozy sleeping nook nestled within a hollowed-out crater. Caution: May encounter friendly space barnacles on the hull.",
  "Get ready to dance among the stars! This state-of-the-art spaceship boasts a pulsating dance floor, a bar that serves up glowing cocktails, and a DJ booth that's always spinning the hottest intergalactic beats. The onboard AI can even create custom playlists based on your mood. Warning: May experience spontaneous karaoke breakouts.",
  "Unplug and unwind in this charming wooden cabin... in space! This unique spaceship features a crackling fireplace hologram, comfy plaid blankets, and a fully stocked library of classic science fiction novels. Curl up with a cup of hot cocoa and watch the stars drift by your window. Note: Bears not included (but we do have a cuddly alien pet you can borrow).",
  "Blast off to the past in this vintage spaceship straight out of a pulp sci-fi novel.  This retro rocket comes complete with a chrome-plated cockpit, fins that shimmer in the sunlight, and a classic onboard jukebox that plays all your favorite space-age tunes. Warning: May experience nostalgia overload.",
  "Dive into a world of aquatic adventure on this submarine spaceship! Explore the depths of alien oceans, discover bioluminescent coral reefs, and get up close and personal with exotic underwater creatures. The onboard aquarium is home to a variety of fascinating alien fish. Note: May experience mild seasickness (or space sickness?) in rough stellar seas.",
  "Indulge in the ultimate space travel experience on this opulent star cruiser.  This floating palace boasts multiple restaurants, a zero-G swimming pool, a spa that offers intergalactic massages, and a theater that shows the latest holographic blockbusters. Please note: Formal attire is required for dinner (but space suits are optional).",
  "Embrace minimalist living in this compact spaceship designed for efficiency and sustainability. This tiny home comes with all the essentials, including a composting toilet, a solar-powered shower, and a hydroponic garden where you can grow your own space veggies. Warning: May experience mild claustrophobia after extended stays (but the views are totally worth it)."
